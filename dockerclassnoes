1. Downloading the images to docker.io
2. Creating a Docker images.

Notes

#Docker containers
Docker containers are a means to package applications and their dependencies in a standardized way. Docker then coined the phraseâ€”Build, ship and run anywhere
There are two flavors of Docker to consider: Docker Enterprise Edition, or Docker EE, and Docker Community Edition


#Containers vs VMs
Containers are lightweight,consume less CPU RAM and disk resources 
standizes packings for software and its dependencies
provides faster deployment and restart easier migration less overhead


#How to developers and Operation works
Developers can focus on bundling applications and dependencies as containers, without agonizing over underlying hardware/infrastructure
Administrators/DevOps team can concentrate on managing containers, without agonizing over the contents of those containers.

#Images,containers and registeries 

Images 
An image is a static representation of the app or service and its configuration and dependencies.
An image is an instance of a container
When an image is started, it gives running container of an image.
A Docker image is built up from a series of layers, allowing a minimal amount of data to be sent when transferring images over network.
Images are stored in a registry such as docker hub

Containers
Container is runtime object or representation of an image.
Containers are lightweight & portable encapsulation of  an environment where applications are run

#Registers
Images are stored in a registry



#Downloading a images
docker run -d -p 801:2368 f3b796dbbc45
